## Call for Contributions

TPBC invites contributed talks in all areas relevant to the theory and practice of blockchains.  This includes:

* consensus protocols,

* cryptographic schemes such as zero-knowledge proofs,

* privacy and anonymity-preserving techniques,

* language design and semantics for smart contracts,

* formal verification of cryptographic protocols and implementations,

* and many other related topics.

The program committee will select talks with the aim of constructing a
balanced program that will be of interest to the TPBC audience.  There will
be no proceedings for TPBC.  Therefore, papers that are already published
and works under review are welcome.


## Details

1. Contributed talks will be 20-30 mins.

2. Submissions can be an extended abstract or a full paper. The submissions can be anonymous if the authors choose to.

3. Deadline for submission of contributed talks is **21 March 2021 (23:59 AoE)**.

4. Notifications of decisions will be sent out by 15 April 2021.
