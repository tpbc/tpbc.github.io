## About
The workshop on Theory and Practice of Blockchains aims to enable interdisciplinary research and foster collaboration among theoreticians and practitioners in blockchain protocols, distributed systems, and cryptography.
The program includes recent research in the sub-themes of consensus protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, privacy and anonymity-preserving techniques, language design and semantics for smart contracts, formal verification of cryptographic protocols and implementations, among other relevant topics.

## Committee 
TPBC21 is organized by the [Cryptology and Data Security group](crypto.unibe.ch) from the University of Bern.
