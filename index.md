## About

The third workshop on Theory and Practice of Blockchains aims to enable interdisciplinary research and foster collaboration among theoreticians and practitioners in blockchain protocols, distributed systems, and cryptography.
The program includes recent research in all areas relevant to the theory and practice of blockchains.  In particular, consensus protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, privacy and anonymity-preserving techniques, language design and semantics for smart contracts, formal verification of cryptographic protocols and implementations, among other relevant topics.


## Format

The workshop features invited presentations and contributed talks.

TPBC 2021 is held as an online weekly seminar series from May 2021 to early
July 2021.  Talks run every Wednesday, starting at 15:00 UTC with a keynote,
followed by three contributed talks, and running until about 17:30 UTC.

Please register to participate.  Sessions will be held online using Zoom, and the link will be sent by email to the registered participants.

We plan to record the sessions and make them available in the Youtube channel of TPBC.
